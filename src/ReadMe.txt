This React project is divided in components , 
every Item from the Inventory page has a form which is controlled by hooks inside the component,
to be able to edit one item and share the state in order to show it in the rest of the page
i could use redux, but i dont have enought time now.
is easy, but takes time.

If i had more time i could have made it more beautiful, and copy exactly the example you gave me.
But first of all i focused on the functionality.
